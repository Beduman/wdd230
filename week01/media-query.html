            <h2>2 Nephi 2:26-27</h2>
            <p>
                26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. 
                And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; 
                to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, 
                according to the commandments which God hath given. 27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; 
                and call things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, 
                through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; 
                for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.
